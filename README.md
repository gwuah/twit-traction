# twit-traction :punch: 

Gain more impressions per tweet. [ good for ad's ] <br>
Simple concept ;  you come across a tweet that looks like it'll blow up, just tweet a special link(check the source code)
to the tweet and the bot will pick it up and post your advert under the tweet that is gaining more interactions.<br>

Documentation might come soon, but if it doesnt, figure out what this beauty does on your own.<br>
You'll need some apikeys for auth from twitter.<br>
Check config.js for help

Run your ``` npm install ```

and run ``` node index.js  ```
